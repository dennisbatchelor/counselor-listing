A shortcode for displaying paginated lists of practitioners.

## Description

Other plugins output paginated lists of all users, but I needed to be able to customize and style this list to fit my use case.  

## Usage

Place this shortcode anywhere you'd like to display a full list of all your Wordpress blog's users.

`
[counselors_practitioner_list state=all country=all details_url=/practitioner-portal/practitioner-details/ ]
`

By default the plugin will print out the practitioners with Certfied membership level and Show Publicly set to Yes.
